## Temporally Coherent Local Tone Mapping of HDR Video
Focus / Aim: to reduce the dynamic range of HDR content while (1) preserving the scene details (2) without introducing artifacts
### Problems
- produce temporal artifacts
- 

### Methods
Decomposing each frame into a base and detail layer
```
base layer
- 
```
#### video tone mapping problems
Two trade-off:
- fine and coarse scale contrast 
- spatial and temporal contrast
### Pros & Cons
- Pros:
  - user adjustable scale (control)

### Contributions / Insights
- A temporally coherent and local video tone mapping method than can maintain a high level of local contrast 
with fewer temporal artifacts
- spatial-temporal filtering
  - specially designed for tone mapping
  - reduce halo artifacts by approximating a global solution


### My Questions
1. Don't quite understand the two trade-offs in video tone mapping..
2. Why not consider global tone mapping?
